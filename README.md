This repository is to identify a software that will oppose a real world issue

Problem Statement:
  Several people, especially new college students, seem to struggle with the transition and the dedication of college life. This consists of mental health, school work, hygiene, financial problems, and more. This leads to people dropping out, failing classes, depression, and lost of motivation. 

  Solution: I want to create a software that assists students with their everyday challenges. Studnets from freshmen to seniors, graduate studnets, and even instructors can use this software. The software will be able to connect to their school work site (Blackboard, Canvas, Google Classroom, etc) and alert studnets to login, study, work, and more. Another feature it will have is give tips throughout the day at certain times. Users will be able to toggle how often these notifications appear, but the tips will include applying for scholarships, personal hygiene (brushing your teeth at night or washing your face in the morning), studying, cleaning your room, and more random tips that people might not think about in the moment. It will have an AI chat bot that will asist students with school work or personal questions, as well as offer them the best advice when asked and search the internet for videos or documents that might aid them in their work. I plan to use generative AI and programming to make this work.
